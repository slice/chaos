# chaos

chaos is a Discord client scraper that aims to be extremely correct, flexible,
and reliable. It is written in [Scala] and makes heavy use of the [cats],
[cats-effect], [fs2], and [http4s] libraries.

## Work in progress

chaos is being rewritten and isn't ready for production at the moment. If you
need to use it now, check out the
[`master`](https://github.com/slice/chaos/tree/master) branch for an earlier
incarnation of the project.
